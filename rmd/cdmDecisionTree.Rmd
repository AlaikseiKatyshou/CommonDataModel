If you have arrived to this page then you must be thinking **HELP! I have some data that doesn't fit in the CDM!** Never fear as this handy guide will point you in the right direction and all you have to do is answer a few questions. 

**First things first, do you have a documented network use case for this data? This could take the form of an upcoming study or a convention for how to store information.** In this scenario, at least two or more collaborators with data to contribute constitute a network need. 

[Yes, I have a network use case](useCaseY.html)

[No, I do not have a network use case](useCaseN.html)
