This working group endeavors to maintain the OMOP CDM as a living model by soliciting and responding to requests from the community based on use cases and research purposes.

You will find information on our meetings and links to join at the end of this page. 

## Current CDM Version

The current CDM version is [CDM v5.4](http://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html), depicted below. This CDM version was developed over the course of a year by considering requests that were sent via our [issues page](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/issues). The list of proposed changes was then shared with the community in multiple ways: through discussions at the weekly OHDSI Community calls, discussions with the OHDSI Steering Committee, and discussions with all potentially affected workgroups. The [final changes](http://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54Changes.html) were then delivered to the Community through a new R package designed to dynamically generate the DDLs and documentation for all supported SQL dialects.
